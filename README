A reorganized workflow for FAANG mRNAseq analysis
Including both Mare and Stallion data
File names are in the form of:
AHx_{tissue}_Rx.fastq.gz
where:
- AHx is the animal ID (AH1-AH4) (AH1, AH2: mares; AH3, AH4: stallions)
- {tissue} is the tissue type; As of 3/11/21, stallions have fewer tissues sequenced than mares
- Rx is read 1 or read 2

Files are of illumina 2x150bp stranded short-read sequencing
